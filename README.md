# RPN

Reverse Polish Notation - assignment.

Netbeans project is in the RPN folder.
Jar file is in the root folder.

In order to run the program the usual command line "java -jar RPN.jar" should work, exit by typing "quit".
It has been manually tested with the input provided in the assignment and a couple of subtraction/division operations.
Only thing to note on output is that the line seperation is not exactly as the sample.

For printing out I had to jump through hoops reversing the PathStack.
A word on the "right" way to do this would be appreciated.

I was not present for the first lecture, and thus I was a little confused as to how we should implement the PathStack.
Gathering what information I could from people who were present, I hope I came somewhat close to what was intended.
